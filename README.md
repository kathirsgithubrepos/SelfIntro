## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Platform Agnostic MLOPs Framework – Pipeline Templates
**Duration**: 1 Year 2 Months (Feb 2023 – April 2024)\
**Client**: American Insurance Company \
**Role**: MLOps Lead \
**Overview:**\
We transformed our Insurance Company machine learning model scoring process by introducing an automated E2E CI/CD pipeline based on MLOps principles, enhancing efficiency, standardization, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. Our customizable, platform agnostic MLOps framework sets the stage for future adoption across various data science and ML capabilities in the organization.\ 

**Key Highlights:** Faster Model Deployment: From 10 days to 5 minutes in the E2E automated CI/CD pipeline using MLOps framework. Standardization and Consistency: Generic MLOps framework ensuring standardized, consistent, and repeatable model deployment processes. Designed comprehensive pipeline templates covering real-time, batch, and training stages for Domino Data Lab, AWS SageMaker, and Google Vertex AI. Established an Organization ML Development Life Cycle (MDLC) workspace promoting reproducibility, collaboration, and governance throughout the ML development process. Tool Stack: CI Pipeline: Jenkins, Unit test/integration Test cases: pytest, Code analysis/coverage: SonarQube, Code scanning: Checkmarx Scan, Image scanning: Prisma Scanning, Data Source: Snowflake, ML Registry and Experiment Tracking: MLflow, Artifacts and Image registry: JFrog, CD Pipeline: Electric Flow, Cloud: AWS, Model Deployment: AWS Lambda, EKS with Seldon, Domino Data Lab, Model Monitoring: Domino Data Lab Model Monitor, Alert: Splunk and Domino Monitoring service. Generic Pipeline Template Details: IAC Pipeline Template: Uses Python wrapper for Domino Data Lab and Terraform for AWS CI Pipeline Template: Includes unit test cases, code analysis, scanning of code and image for vulnerabilities, pushing the image to JFrog. Training Pipeline Template: Handles downloading the scanned image from artifacts, performing training, and sending model artifacts to the MLflow Model Registry CD - Deployment Pipeline Template: Covers batch and real-time inference scenarios with respective deployment methods. Model Monitoring is enabled in Domino Data Lab for both real-time and batch inferences. Models Onboarded using above Pipelines: PI Injection analyzer, PII Analyzer, PII Anonymizer, Annuitization, Imputed Compensation, Outflow, Inflow etc.


### Automated MLOps Framework with AWS Sagemaker and Services.
**Duration**: 3 Months (Dec 2022 – Feb 2023) Client: Lifescience Company\ 
**Role**: MLOps Lead \
**Overview**: \
The MLOps Framework with AWS provides a comprehensive solution for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from development to deployment and maintenance. Built according to the XENA framework, this approach utilizes Jenkins and AWS as its primary technology stack, offering key benefits such as scalability, automation, monitoring & debugging, and seamless integration. Key Highlights: Fully automated CI/CD/CT pipelines implemented within MLOps. Utilizing cutting-edge tools and technologies, including Python, Jenkins, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (Iac), and AWS services such as:
· Amazon SageMaker (Studio, Model Registry, Monitoring, Training, Processing Jobs, etc.)
· AWS Lambda Functions, ECR
· Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
· AWS Event Bridge
· AWS API Gateway 
- As an MLOps Lead, I was responsible for designing, implementing, and continuously improving upon this robust framework, collaborating closely with data scientists for smooth and efficient operations throughout the entire machine learning lifecycle.
